# Home-Lab
This will be the documentation to my home lab that I am going to be building to test and try out new software and services that I am looking to explore.
For the current home lab set up that I am going to be working on setting up I am looking to be able to make NAS for my house that I will also be able to
access remotely and give family and other people access to so that they can store files that might be taking up a lot of space on their computers.
I am also looking to use it for VM's for my labs to continue my cybersecurity journey and to better my skills for my current position in IT.
